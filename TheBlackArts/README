# The Black Arts

The Black Arts is a turn-based strategy card game. The game is played with two players, each with a 52 card deck.
Each player begins the game with 100 hit points (HP). A player wins the game by reducing his or her opponent's
HP to 0.

## Cards
There are three types of Cards in The Black Arts:

1. Gold,
2. Asset (Living and Non-living), and
3. Action (Fast and Slow).

All Cards have a suit: club, spade, heart, or diamond. How suits work will be explained through examples below.

### Gold Cards
"There's gold in them, thar hills!"

Gold cards comprise the "economy" component of The Black Arts.

Gold Cards are of one of four suits:

- Club,
- Heart,
- Spade, or
- Diamond.

Players may play *one* Gold card per turn.

#### Example 1.1

John has a **Gold Spade** in his hand. It is his turn and he has not
played any other Gold cards. He may play his **Gold Spade** card.
John already has a ** Gold Spade** in play.

John has a fast Action Card in his hand called **Arrow of Fire**.
**Arrow of Fire** costs one Spade (♠♠) to buy (play the card from his hand).
John uses his two **Gold Spades** that are in play to pay for and play ** Arrow of Fire **.

**Arrow of Fire** deals 15 damage to John's opponent, Kai,
reducing Kai's HP from 100, to 85. Huzzah!

### Asset Cards
Asset Cards form the "meat" of The Black Arts. Asset cards are of two types

- Living, and
- Non-living.

#### Living Asset Cards
Living Assets are best described with an example:
A **Bear** Living Asset has two main attributes, Attack and Hit Points. A **Bear** is a "vanilla" Living Asset that costs (♥♥).
It Attacks for 10 and it has 10 Hit Points; and nothing more. Let's say it is Alice's turn, and she has a **Bear**
Living Asset in play. Alice enters her attack phase and attacks John with her **Bear** Asset. John has no Assets to
defend with, and no cards in his hand. John is currently at 20 Hit Points. John takes 10 and his HP is reduced to 10.
One more swipe of the Bear's claw, and John will be toast!

- Living-Assets have Attack (how much they hit for against other Living Assets, and against Opponents),
- Living-Assets have Hit Points (how much they defend against other Living Assets, or Action cards that do damage,
- Living-Assets may have other attributes, described in it's body text, that affect various game mechanics.
- All Living-Assets have a suit, club, spade, heart, or diamond (these correspond to the types of Gold to purchase them from your hand and put them into play),
- Living-Assets may only be played on a player's turn, unless otherwise stated.

### Non-living Asset Cards
Non-living Assets cost Gold, just like Living Assets do, but they do not have Attack and Hit Points.
Instead they can have Global effecets on the game, or they can allow their owner to buy an effect.

Example:
**Heroic Strength** is a Non-Living Asset. It costs (♥♥).
**Heroic Strength**'s body text reads:
Give all Living-Assets with a suit of Heart (♥) +5 Attack, +5 HP.
As long as **Heroic Strength** remains in play, all Heart Living-Assets attack for 5 more, and have 5 more HP.
This illustrates an important concept in The Black Arts. All cards have a suit, club, spade, heart, or diamond.
These suits determine which type of Gold can be used to buy an Asset (Living or Non-living) and an Action. A Card's
suit also allows for global effects to effect them, such as **Heroic Strength**.

- Non-living assets may also have options to buy effects with gold,
- Non-living assets have a suit, club, spade, heart, or diamond,
- Non-living assets may only be played on a player's turn, unless otherwise stated.

## Note on Running out of Cards
In The Black Arts, there is no notion of "decking". When a player runs out of cards,
his or her Dead Zone is shuffled back into his or her deck. This can lead to some interesting
strategies.

## Winning the Game
A game is won when one player runs the other player out of hit points, from 100 to 0.
